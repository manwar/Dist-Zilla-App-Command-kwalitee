=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::App::Command::kwalitee - calculate CPANTS kwalitee score for your dist

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 dzil kwalitee [ --core | -c ] [ --experimental | -e ]
               [ --verbose | -v ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command is a thin wrapper around the functionality in
L<App::CPANTS::Lint>, which is itself a wrapper around functionality in
L<Module::CPANTS::Analyse>.

From within the top directory of your distribution you can run:

 % dzil kwalitee

Which saves you from having to run:

 % dzil build
 % cpants_lint.pl <tarball>

You might argue that if you're "doing Dist::Zilla right",
then you shouldn't need to run `cpants_lint.pl`,
but when I'm adopting distributions and switching them to Dist::Zilla
I find myself running the two commands above.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<App::CPANTS::Lint> does the actual work of this command.
It is the core of the L<cpants_lint.pl> script.

L<Module::CPANTS::Analyse> is the module behind L<App::CPANTS::Lint>,
which actually does the analysis.

L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Kwalitee> is a plugin that generates a
release test using L<Test::Kwalitee>.

L<CPANTS|http://cpants.cpanauthors.org> is the website where you
can see the Kwalitee score for all distributions on CPAN.
As a CPAN author you can see a dashboard for all your dists.
For example, my PAUSE id is NEILB, so my dashboard is at:

 http://cpants.cpanauthors.org/author/NEILB
